# Steps to install SASS via npm (Node.js):

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If not, download it from:
   https://nodejs.org/

2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or shell).

3. Run the following command to install Sass globally:
   npm install -g sass@3.7.4

4. Verify the installation by checking the installed version:
   sass --version
   # Expected output: 3.7.4 (or the installed version)

5. (Optional) To use Sass in a project without global installation:
   npm install sass@3.7.4 --save-dev
